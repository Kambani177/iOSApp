# iOSApp
The code in this repository shows an iOS music player application that I created using SwiftUi and XCode12.
The app has the functionality that you would expect from a music player and is also capable of background play(playing music when you leave the app)
The app does not use the mp3 files stored in your phone but uses the firebase API to bring the music stored on firebase to your phone.
The app uses firebase for the backend
